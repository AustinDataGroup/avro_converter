Avro Converter
==============

This is a converter to turn .csv data files into .avro files

### To use

place your CSV files inside the csv directory. If you have not already,
create a schema with the same name inside the schemas directory.

```python
  python app.py
```

### Note
Make sure your csv files have a header row because the python script
expects one.
